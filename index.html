    <p>
      French fries, and chips, finger chips, french-fried potatoes, or simply
      fries are batonnet or allumette-cut deep-fried potatoes of disputed origin
      <br />
      from Belgium or France. They are prepared by cutting potatoes into even
      strips, drying them, and frying them, usually in a deep fryer.
